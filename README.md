# Emerald (PxStat Fork)

**Emerald** is a Proof of Concept (PoC) Open Data and Data Dissemination Tool, developed as a fork of PxStat to serve as a prototype. This is the second such prototype designed to explore data dissemination solutions for statistics.

Emerald is based on PxStat, a  Data Dissemination Management System developed by the Central Statistics Office, Ireland (CSO). This fork aims to evaluate the feasibility of deploying PxStat as an Open Data platform tailored to Scottish Government needs.

## Features

Emerald retains all core functionalities of PxStat, including:
- **Modern and responsive web interface** for exploring, filtering, and visualizing statistical data.
- **Extensive metadata search** with options to pivot, slice, and dice datasets.
- **Multiple export formats** including JSON-Stat, PX, XLSX, and CSV.
- **Interactive visualizations** such as charts and geo-maps.
- **API access** for automated data retrieval.
- **Workflow management** for data publication, release tracking, and embargo policies.

## Objectives of the Emerald Prototype

- Assess the adaptability of PxStat for Scottish Government data publication.
- Test the systemâ€™s capabilities in handling open data requirements.
- Evaluate potential enhancements and custom functionality in line with strategy.
- Explore integration with existing Scottish Government data tools
- Incorporate the Scottish Government Design System
